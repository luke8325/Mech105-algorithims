## Desciption FalsePosition
##### This program calculates the roots of a function from a function, upper and lower bounts, the relative error, and the maximum iterations that the user inputs.  
#### Inputs:
##### func = user inputed function 
##### xl = user inputed lower bound 
##### xu is the user inputed lower bound, 
##### es is the desired relative error (if there is not one input then it defaults to 0.0001%) 
##### maxit = user inputed maximum number of iterations (if there is not one input then it defaults to 200).
#### Outputs
##### root = root of the function 
##### fx = the function evaluated at the root
##### ea = relative error
##### iter = number the iterations
