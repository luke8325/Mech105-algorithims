## Desciption FalsePosition
##### This program calculates the roots of a function from a function, upper and lower bounts, the relative error, and the maximum iterations that the user inputs.  
#### Inputs:
##### func is the user inputed function, x_l is the user inputed lower bound, x_u is the user inputed lower bound, es is the desired relative error (if there is not one input then it defaults to 0.0001%), and maxit is the user inputed maximum number of iterations (if there is not one input then it defaults to 200).
#### Outputs
##### root is the root of the function, fx is the function evaluated at the root, ea is the relative error, and iter is number the iterations.
