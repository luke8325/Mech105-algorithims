## Desciption LU Factorization
##### This function takes the input of a square coefficient matrix and from that matrix it creates a lower triantular matix, upper triantular matrix, and a pivot matrix in order to solve for the unknown variables of the equations that the numbers in the coeficient matrix orginated from.
#### Inputs:
##### A is the square coefficient matrix
#### Outputs:
##### L is the lower triangular matrix, U is the upper triangular matrix, P is the pivot matrix.
