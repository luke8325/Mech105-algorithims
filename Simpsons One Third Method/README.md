#### Author: Luke Davis
##### Date: 05/03/2021
## Description: Simpson's 1/3
##### This function uses a combination of simpson's 1/3 method and the trapazoidal rule to comput an estimate of the integral of a set of data points. If there are an odd number of intervals or only 2 data points, the trapezoidal rule will be used on the last interval. The x values MUST be equally spaced for this algorithim to work
#### Inputs
##### x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
#####  y = the vector of function values with respect to x
#### Outputs:
##### I = the numerical integral calculated
